Data folders descriptions
==========================

The directory data/stampede contains data collected
for the Metropolis algorithm and the grand ensemble.


Metropolis algorithm
---------------------
Independent simulations of different dimensions are collected in
  different subdirectories.
For example, all three dimensional simulations are collected under 
  the directory D3.


Grand ensemble simulations
---------------------------
Algorithm G1 were not used
An algorithm G2 directory is like D25n64
An algorithm G3 directory is like D70r4n64,
  here the number `4' following the letter `r' means that
  there are four intermediate ensembles between two n's.

Directory with the suffix Z are devoted for the partition functions,
  and no star or ring content was computed.
