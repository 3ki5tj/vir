Overview
=========
Basic routines of manipulating diagrams (graphs)



Files
------
dg.h        basic diagram
dgcsep.h    clique separator
dgcs.h      Ree-Hoover star content, which can be used to compute
            the total weight of a configuration of a hard-sphere system
dgrjw.h     the total weight of a configuration of a hard-sphere system
            alternative algorithm by R. J. Wheatley
dgdb.h      database
dgque.h     short history list


Utility programs
-----------------
bcstat.c    compute the probability of making a biconnected diagram
            from a chain configuration (as in the MC integration)

testrjw.c   test the speed
