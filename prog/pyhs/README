pyhs.ma     the original version
            intepolation along the packing fraction t
            the polynomial obtained at a particular t is normalized
            such that when X = 0 it matches the value of polynomial
            for the radius of convergence


pyhs2.ma    the improved version
            intepolation along the packing fraction t
            the polynomial obtained at a particular t is normalized
            against the leading term of X


getvir.ma   handle the virial coefficients
