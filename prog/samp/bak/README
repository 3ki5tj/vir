bak: old programs
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
dgcnt.c     count the number of the biconnected diagrams

dgmc.c      calculate the virial coefficients by Monte Carlo sampling
            this program directly samples over diagrams without using
            the Ree-Hoover star contents. So it is not very efficient

mcrepl.c    coordinate replacement as a Monte Carlo move

mcrat.c     sampling biconnected configurations, coupled with a sampler
            that samples configurations without clique separators and an
            importance sampler that samples configurations for fb

mcratn.c    sampling along the number of clique separators

mcwt.c      prototype code for mcrat.c sampling in three ensembles
            biconnected, nonzero fb, and importance sampling

mcnz.c      prototype code for sampling in two ensembles
            biconnected and nonzero fb

mcgcx.c     supposed to be a better version than mcgcr.c
            involves a scaling of diagrams
            developed before mcgcr.c

mcgcr.v1.c  Metropolis and heat-bath algorithms for mcgcr
mcgcr2.v1.c very few differences

mcrat0L.c   a variant of mcrat0.c for the larger lookup table (dgmapl.h)

mcrat1.c    a variant of mcrat0.c, simpler coding

mcrat0ed.c  a variant of mcrat0.c that uses tempering on the number of edges
