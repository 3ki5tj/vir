Manuscript Instructions
========================

The manuscript can be accessed in two locations.  The first location is
	/Bossman/cz1/vir/iedoc
The second location, for off-campus access, is the following Dropbox link
	https://www.dropbox.com/sh/qwtgxlf0uti88aa/AABk72-VvDWvBLSV56Xufsk-a?dl=0
In both locations, selected references can be found in the ``refs'' sub-directory.

The complete PDF manuscript is ievirdoc.pdf.

The source Word document is ievirtext.doc.

Please make changes on the Word version ievirtext.doc.
Microsoft Word has a useful "Track Changes" feature.
If it is not turned on, please turn it on before editing.

There is an EndNote library including all references:
	ievir.enl
and
	ievir.Data
directory.

The PDF manuscript includes a supplemental material in the end.
However, this is only intended to help the reviewers, and we may not publish it.
The supplemental material is written in LaTeX, and the stand-alone PDF is iegraph.pdf

The notes of the manuscript are collected in ievirnotes.tex, or ievirnotes.pdf


Data and Programs
========================

Integral equation code        /Bossman/cz1/vir/prog/ievircode.zip

Mayer sampling code           /Bossman/cz1/vir/prog/vircode.zip
(with correlation functions)

Integral equation data        /Bossman/cz1/vir/data/iedata.zip

Gaussian model data           /Bossman/cz1/vir/data/gaussfdata.zip



Manuscript Checklist (for CZ)
=============================

o Turn on the "Track Changes" feature in Microsoft Word.
o Check that each label equation is referenced at least once.
o Check that the punctuation after each equation.
o Press F9 to update links (should be done automatically when printed to PDF).
o Run EndNote to update the references.
o Export EndNote references to ievir.enl.
o EndNote style changes:
  * In Table II, change the style of reference 16 from superscript to normal font.
  * In the Appendix for Mayer sampling of correlation functions (H.1 currently)
    following "using the convention of",  Ref. 15
    the "15" should not be in the normal instead of superscript font.
o Check the equation numbers in the arrow equations:
  PY:         the equation after Eq. (11)
  HNC:        the equation after Eq. (20)
  YBG:        the equation after Eq. (D2)
  Kirkwood:   the equation after Eq. (E7)
o Check if the units of equations make sense.
o Run make clean && make on the figure directory to use the latest data set
