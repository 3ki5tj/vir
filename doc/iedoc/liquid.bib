  abstract ={Several attempts have been presented to take account of terms corresponding to large graphs in the cluster expansion formulae for the free energy and the radial distribution function, for the purpose of applying them to a gas of not small density or to a liquid. In this paper is proposed an approximation, which includes the approximations in the past as the first or second approximation, by taking account of graphs which can be easily evaluated by means of the Fourier transformation.The graphs taken into account in our approximation are all those which can be constructed starting from a line  or a ring  by a sequence of the processes to replace a constituent line  by a watermelon ; in the course of the replacement, a line in a watermelon is also allowed to be replaced by a watermelon. The approximation will be called the hyper-netted chain approximation.The formulae obtained in this approximation for the free energy and the radial distribution function are given by eqs. (29′)−(30′) and eq. (35), which demand the solution of a recurrence equation containing the Fourier transformations.The expansion formulae for the free energy and the radial distribution function by means of the “hyper-netted chains” are also presented. They contain the results in the hyper-netted chain approximation as their leading terms.Another set of the formulae in the hypere-netted chain approximation is given and compared with the theories for ionic system in the past.Applications to practical problems will be given in forthcoming papers.},

The Helmholtz free energy is expressed as a series expansion which may be more rapidly convergent than the usual one. It is shown that the integral equation can be derived also by means of a variational principle from the expression for the free energy. It is pointed out that the theory of classical fluids may be constructed with the knowledge of the pair distribution function alone, even if a form of the pair interaction potential is not known.},

Some thermodynamic functions are expressed in terms of these distribution functions. It is shown that there exist variational principles saying that the grand partition function is to be maximum with respect to the variations in the one- and two-particle distribution functions. Variational principles are found also for the Helmholtz free energy. It is suggested that Mayer's theory of condensation may in fact give the end point of the metastable gaseous state.

A discussion is given of the structure of the Mayer type of diagrams which correspond to the different contributions to the pair correlation function. The method takes into account in the successive steps of the approximation, diagrams of increasing complexity as regards “the basic structure”, a concept which is fully defined in this paper in §5. In each step of the approximation an infinity of diagrams, corresponding to density terms up to infinite order, is included. Numerical calculations are in progress for evaluating the pair correlation function in the “zeroth” approximation, which takes into account all diagrams, which can be obtained by successive series and parallel connection of subdiagrams, using the single bond as starting element. It is possible that also the next step in the approximation, including diagrams of a more complex basic structure, can be made with high speed computors. "

A set of multiform distribution functions is defined, and the generalized continuity equations satisfied by these functions are derived. By introducing the equations of motion, a set of relations is obtained from which the distribution functions may be determined. It is shown that Boltzmann's equation in the kinetic theory of gases follows as a particular case, and that, in equilibrium conditions, the theory gives results consistent with statistical mechanics. An integral equation for the radial distribution function is obtained which is the natural generalization of one obtained by Kirkwood for 'rigid spherical molecules'. Finally, it is indicated how the theory may be applied to solve both equilibrium and dynamical problems of the liquid state.},

  abstract = "A new analytic equation of state for the Lennard-Jones fluid is proposed. The equation is based on a perturbed virial expansion with a theoretically defined temperature-dependent reference hard sphere term. The expansion is written for the Helmholtz free energy which guarantees the thermodynamic consistency of the pressure and internal energy. The equation covers much wider range of temperatures (up to seven times the critical temperature) than existing equations and is significantly more accurate and has less parameters than the best equation available to date, the modified Benedict-Webb-Rubin equation due to Johnson, Zollweg, and Gubbins (1993, Mol. Phys. 78: 591-618). As a side-product, highly accurate explicit analytic correlations of the hard sphere diameters, as given by both the hybrid Barker-Henderson and Weeks-Chandler-Andersen theories, have been obtained. Computer simulation data to be regressed by the equation have been compiled from several sources and critically assessed. It has been shown that many literature data for state points with a large compressibility are subject to large systematic finite-size errors. Additional simulations on a series of systems of different sizes have been therefore performed to facilitate the extrapolation to the thermodynamic limit in the region close to the critical point. ",
