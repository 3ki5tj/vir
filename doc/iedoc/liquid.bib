  abstract ={Several attemps have been presented to take account of terms corresponding to large graphs in the cluster expansion formulae for the free energy and the radial distribution function, for the purpose of applying them to a gas of not small density or to a liquid. In this paper is proposed an approximation, which includes the approximations in the past as the first or second approximation, by taking account of graphs which can be easily evaluated by means of the Fourier transformation.The graphs taken into account in our approximation are all those which can be constructed starting from a line  or a ring  by a sequence of the processes to replace a constituent line  by a watermelon ; in the course of the replacement, a line in a watermelon is also allowed to be replaced by a watermelon. The approximation will be called the hyper-netted chain approximation.The formulae obtained in this approximation for the free energy and the radial distribution function are given by eqs. (29′)−(30′) and eq. (35), which demand the solution of a recurrence equation containing the Fourier transformations.The expansion formulae for the free energy and the radial distribution function by means of the “hyper-netted chains” are also presented. They contain the results in the hyper-netted chain approximation as their leading terms.Another set of the formulae in the hypere-netted chain approximation is given and compared with the theories for ionic system in the past.Applications to practical problems will be given in forthcoming papers.},

  abstract = "The hyper-chain approximation in the theory of classical fluids, and a second approximation in which some account is taken of the first elementary diagram, are examined for internal consistency by calculating virial expansions of the pressure both directly and from the compressibility equation. Both theories are internally inconsistent at the fourth virial coefficient. Numerical results are presented for both fourth and fifth virial coefficients for a gas of hard spheres, and compared with those given by earlier treatments. A brief comment is made on the consistency of the equations for fluid mixtures. "

  abstract ={This paper outlines a general theory whose object is to provide a basis from which all the equilibrium and dynamical properties of liquids can be investigated. A set of multiform distribution functions is defined, and the generalized continuity equations satisfied by these functions are derived. By introducing the equations of motion, a set of relations is obtained from which the distribution functions may be determined. It is shown that Boltzmann's equation in the kinetic theory of gases follows as a particular case, and that, in equilibrium conditions, the theory gives results consistent with statistical mechanics. An integral equation for the radial distribution function is obtained which is the natural generalization of one obtained by Kirkwood for 'rigid spherical molecules'. Finally, it is indicated how the theory may be applied to solve both equilibrium and dynamical problems of the liquid state.},
