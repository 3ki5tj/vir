  abstract ={Several attempts have been presented to take account of terms corresponding to large graphs in the cluster expansion formulae for the free energy and the radial distribution function, for the purpose of applying them to a gas of not small density or to a liquid. In this paper is proposed an approximation, which includes the approximations in the past as the first or second approximation, by taking account of graphs which can be easily evaluated by means of the Fourier transformation.The graphs taken into account in our approximation are all those which can be constructed starting from a line  or a ring  by a sequence of the processes to replace a constituent line  by a watermelon ; in the course of the replacement, a line in a watermelon is also allowed to be replaced by a watermelon. The approximation will be called the hyper-netted chain approximation.The formulae obtained in this approximation for the free energy and the radial distribution function are given by eqs. (29′)−(30′) and eq. (35), which demand the solution of a recurrence equation containing the Fourier transformations.The expansion formulae for the free energy and the radial distribution function by means of the “hyper-netted chains” are also presented. They contain the results in the hyper-netted chain approximation as their leading terms.Another set of the formulae in the hypere-netted chain approximation is given and compared with the theories for ionic system in the past.Applications to practical problems will be given in forthcoming papers.},

The Helmholtz free energy is expressed as a series expansion which may be more rapidly convergent than the usual one. It is shown that the integral equation can be derived also by means of a variational principle from the expression for the free energy. It is pointed out that the theory of classical fluids may be constructed with the knowledge of the pair distribution function alone, even if a form of the pair interaction potential is not known.},

Some thermodynamic functions are expressed in terms of these distribution functions. It is shown that there exist variational principles saying that the grand partition function is to be maximum with respect to the variations in the one- and two-particle distribution functions. Variational principles are found also for the Helmholtz free energy. It is suggested that Mayer's theory of condensation may in fact give the end point of the metastable gaseous state.

A discussion is given of the structure of the Mayer type of diagrams which correspond to the different contributions to the pair correlation function. The method takes into account in the successive steps of the approximation, diagrams of increasing complexity as regards ``the basic structure'', a concept which is fully defined in this paper in \S 5. In each step of the approximation an infinity of diagrams, corresponding to density terms up to infinite order, is included. Numerical calculations are in progress for evaluating the pair correlation function in the ``zeroth'' approximation, which takes into account all diagrams, which can be obtained by successive series and parallel connection of subdiagrams, using the single bond as starting element. It is possible that also the next step in the approximation, including diagrams of a more complex basic structure, can be made with high speed computers."

A set of multiform distribution functions is defined, and the generalized continuity equations satisfied by these functions are derived. By introducing the equations of motion, a set of relations is obtained from which the distribution functions may be determined. It is shown that Boltzmann's equation in the kinetic theory of gases follows as a particular case, and that, in equilibrium conditions, the theory gives results consistent with statistical mechanics. An integral equation for the radial distribution function is obtained which is the natural generalization of one obtained by Kirkwood for 'rigid spherical molecules'. Finally, it is indicated how the theory may be applied to solve both equilibrium and dynamical problems of the liquid state.},

  abstract = "A new analytic equation of state for the Lennard-Jones fluid is proposed. The equation is based on a perturbed virial expansion with a theoretically defined temperature-dependent reference hard sphere term. The expansion is written for the Helmholtz free energy which guarantees the thermodynamic consistency of the pressure and internal energy. The equation covers much wider range of temperatures (up to seven times the critical temperature) than existing equations and is significantly more accurate and has less parameters than the best equation available to date, the modified Benedict-Webb-Rubin equation due to Johnson, Zollweg, and Gubbins (1993, Mol. Phys. 78: 591-618). As a side-product, highly accurate explicit analytic correlations of the hard sphere diameters, as given by both the hybrid Barker-Henderson and Weeks-Chandler-Andersen theories, have been obtained. Computer simulation data to be regressed by the equation have been compiled from several sources and critically assessed. It has been shown that many literature data for state points with a large compressibility are subject to large systematic finite-size errors. Additional simulations on a series of systems of different sizes have been therefore performed to facilitate the extrapolation to the thermodynamic limit in the region close to the critical point. ",

  abstract={In a recent paper we derived an expression for the replicated free energy of a liquid of hard spheres based on the hypernetted chain (HNC) free energy functional. An approximate equation of state for the glass and an estimate of the random close packing density were obtained for d = 3. Here we show that the HNC approximation is not needed: the same expression can be obtained from the full diagrammatic expansion of the replicated free energy. Then, we consider the asymptotics of this expression when the space dimension d is very large. In this limit, the entropy of the hard sphere liquid has been computed exactly. Using this solution, we derive asymptotic expressions for the glass transition density and for the random close packing density for hard spheres for large space dimension.}

  abstract={We consider the theory of the glass transition and jamming of hard spheres in the large space dimension limit. Previous investigations were based on the assumption that the probability distribution within a `cage' is Gaussian, which is not fully consistent with numerical results. Here we perform a replica calculation without making any assumption on the cage shape. We show that thermodynamic functions turn out to be exact within the Gaussian ansatz—provided one allows for arbitrary replica symmetry breaking—and indeed agree well with numerical results. The actual structure function (the so-called non-ergodic parameter) is not Gaussian, an apparent paradox which we discuss. In this paper we focus on the free energy, future papers will present the results for the structure functions and a detailed comparison with numerical results.}

  abstract={A new approximation to the theory of a classical fluid of number density ρ in equilibrium at absolute temperature T is investigated. Although the model takes some account of the elementary diagrams, it is nevertheless such that all clusters retained in the number-density expansions of the total correlation function h ( r ) and the direct correlation function c ( r ) are of simple hyper-netted chain type. The approximation, which is defined by the integral equation h ( r 12 ) - c ( r 12 ) = y m ( r 12 ) ln y ( r 12 ) = ρ∫ c ( r 13 ) h ( r 23 )d r 3 where y ( r ) = {1 + h ( r )} exp{ u ( r )/ kT } and u ( r ) is the interaction potential between two atoms at distance r apart, reduces to the hyper-netted chain approximation when m = 0. Cluster-integral expressions have been obtained for all the `compressibility' and `pressure' virial coefficients up to and including F c and F p , and these have been evaluated in the particular case of a hard-sphere gas. When the adjustable parameter m is so chosen that D c = D p , the numerical estimates of the virial coefficients E c and F c are found to be identical with the true values of the fifth and sixth virial coefficients, respectively, of the hard-sphere gas. In addition, for parameter values in the range 0.4 ≤ m ≤ 0.45 the present model approaches overall internal consistency much more closely than is the case with any previously studied approximation of comparable simplicity.}

  abstract ={Four new integral equations for the radial distribution function g(r) suitable for a fluid (including a charged-particle system, such as plasmas, electrolyte solutions and molten salts) interacting via a potential consisting of a strong repulsive short-range part and a slow-varying long-range part are derived by Percus’ functional-expansion method. The first equation of them is composed of two equations: one is the Percus-Yevick (PY) equation involving the short-range part of the potential and the other an equation involving the long-range part. The second is an extended PY equation in which the long-range potential is taken into account in the form of the Hartree field. The third equation is derived on the basis of an improvement on the thermodynamical equation determining the density n(r|U) in a nonuniform system under an external field U(r). The fourth equation is a combination of the second and third equations.As an illustration, the first integral equation is solved for a system with potential v(r)= erf(ζr)(Ze)2/r+hard-sphere for θ from 10.0 to 0.01, where θ=kBTa/(Ze)2, a=[3/4πn0]1/3, n0 the average density and Z the valency. The result for θ=10.0 agrees quite well with the non-linear Debye-Huckel result. At θ=1.0 there is a close agreement between the present result and the Monte Carlo result. As θ increases, g(r) begins to oscillate around unity and resembles g(r) of a neutral fluid.},

				The theory of fluids based on the radial distribution function, g(r), is related to the direct correlation function, f(r), of scattering theory. The simplest form of the Born-Green theory is shown to be intimately related to the first approximation to f(r). The second approximation to f(r) is considered in detail, and shown to effect a considerable improvement on earlier theories. It leads to a critical point at which p/$\rho $kT = $\frac{1}{3}$. Fournet{\textquoteright}s application of the Born-Green theory to X-ray scattering by fluids is shown to be correct only to the first power in the density $\rho $. The terms in $\rho $ and $\rho ^{2}$ are considered in detail for the case of hard spheres.},

A new virial-based expression is here proposed which achieves these aims. For that{,} we use the fact that the currently accepted estimated values for the highest virial coefficients behave linearly with their order{,} and also that virial coefficients must have a limiting behaviour that permits the closest packing limit in the compressibility factor to be also adequately reproduced."

Firstly an account is given of the methodologies used for calculating the virial coefficients, both in isotropic and liquid crystalline phases. We then consider the isotropic phase, looking at the radius of convergence of the series for one component systems, mixtures and systems with attractive interactions. We next consider the application of a virial analysis to disordered liquid crystalline phases (nematic and cubatic). Finally, we speculate as to future interesting lines of research in this area, in particular the possibility of applying the virial series to positionally ordered phases.}

The relative inaccuracy at the 95% confidence level is better than 0.00004 for all densities but the last deeply metastable point. This accuracy requires careful examination of finite size effects and other possible sources of errors and applying corrections. The data are fitted to a power series in y/(1 - y){,} where y is the packing fraction; the coefficients are determined so that virial coefficients B2 to B6 are reproduced. To do this{,} values of B5 and B6 are accurately recalculated. Virial coefficients up to B11 are then estimated from the equation of state."

We used these coefficients in the virial equation of state (VEOS) to obtain compressibility factor, Z, at super critical temperatures and found to be in excellent agreement with the predictions of equations of state based on mean spherical approximation (EOS-MSA) for Yukawa fluids up to a reduced density, ρ*, of 0.5. We inspected virial coefficients in representing the \{PVT\} behavior along the saturated vapor line of Yukawa fluids. VEOS4, \{VEOS5\} and \{VEOS6\} describe the \{PVT\} behavior along the saturated vapor line reasonably good for λ&#xa0;=&#xa0;1.8, 3.0 and 4.0; and at higher λ, \{VEOS4\} and \{VEOS5\} represent the \{PVT\} behavior better than the series that includes B6.

  abstract = "Free energy simulation method is applied to calculate the virial coefficients of square-well (SW) fluids of variable well-width and square-well based dimer forming associating fluids. In this approach, Monte Carlo sampling is performed on a number of molecules equal to the order of integral, and configurations are weighted according to the absolute value of the integrand. An umbrella-sampling average yields the value of the cluster integral in reference to a known integral. By using this technique, we determine the virial coefficients up to \{B6\} for \{SW\} fluid with variable potential range from λ&#xa0;=&#xa0;1.25 to λ&#xa0;=&#xa0;3.0 and model associating fluids with different association strengths: ɛaf&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.0, 8.0, 16.0 and 22.0. These calculated values for \{SW\} fluids are in good agreement with the literature. We examine these coefficients in the context of the virial equation of state (VEOS) of \{SW\} fluids. \{VEOS\} up to \{B4\} or up to \{B6\} describes the \{PVT\} behavior along the saturated vapor line better than the series that includes B5. We used these coefficients to find the critical properties of \{SW\} fluids and compared with the literature values. Boyle temperature is also determined and is found to increase with the increase in the well-extent and associating strength. We also report Joule–Thomson inversion curve for Lennard–Jones fluid and \{SW\} fluids using different truncated \{VEOS\} and compared with that predicted from established EOS. "
